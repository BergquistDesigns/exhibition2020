	<p><b>Who should be able to breathe?</b></p>
	<p>The Principles of Environmental Justice (https://www.ejnet. org/ej/principles.html), first drafted in 1991, proclaimed clean air, land, water, and food to be fundamental rights. Yet more than one in ten people living in the United States have asth- ma, a respiratory illness that is aggravated by environmental conditions, including air pollution. The burden of asthma is unequally distributed across geographies characterized by race, ethnicity, and economic status.</p>
	<p>I explored ways in which design might help communities facing an increased burden of illness from environmental factors to form a collective understanding of illness in order to advocate for change together.</p>

<div class="flow-half">
	<p>Breathing Injustice is a workshop centered around a simple device to explore asthma as a sociologically produced disease using the breath as a physical interface. The work- shop simulates spatialized socioeconomic and environmental factors and their impact on the experience of asthma. This approach helps build social cohesion around the root causes by framing asthma as a collective illness, rather than one affecting isolated individuals. The kit is packaged with a curriculum guide to help community health advocacy organi- zations and activists facilitate asthma awareness workshops. The Breathing Injustice Workshop helps people understand asthma from an environmental perspective to form publics that can advocate for communities facing an increased bur- den of the disease.</p>

	<h2>Audio Guide</h2>
</div>
<div class="flow-half">
	<p>Air hunger, or medically “dyspnea,” gets at the essential experience of asthma. Anyone who has held their breath is fa- miliar with the sensation of air hunger. The breathing device I designed is the central component of the workshop. The user places the tube in their mouth and breathes through it. As the user turns the dial from 0 to 6, it restricts airflow, simulating airway constriction similar to asthma.</p>
	<p>An audio guide directs the participants’ movement through space and indicates which settings on the breathing device correspond to spatial triggers. The guide presents scenarios using narration and sound cues.	</p>
