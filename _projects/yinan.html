		<p>The Origin-Destination(O-D) pattern is a fundamental concept in transportation. It summarizes people and vehicle movements across geographical regions. Visualizing Boston employees’ home and work distribution is one way to understand Boston commuters’ mobility pattern and predict the commuters' needs for transit service planning.</p>
		<p>However, concerning the visual clarity for representing multi-dimensional data in a single plot, visualizing Origin-Destination (O-D) flow is always a challenge. This project discussed design approaches for it, and suggested how an abstract data value could become more connected with people’s perception of a place in reality.</p>

		<p>Many works show a total value of flows with its geolocations. Those visualizations lost the individual trip view and others information by aggregating the data.</p>
		<p>Being able to see a more granular geographic pattern of the O-D flow could reveal layers of information and the intermediate steps of it, which is essential to describing this O-D pattern. With a more granular map visualization, it could show the flow variation within different geographic levels and more details of spatial references. That means the data within its geolocation could be more understood and accepted by people, its definition in reality. Also, increased granularity is more interesting to view and explore unknown patterns.</p>

    <h2>The Mobility of All Boston Employees</h2>	
    </div>
	<div class="flow-half">
		<p>Boston is the capital city of Massachusetts and the region's central hub, located in Suffolk County. It has the highest concentration of employment, which also affects the nearby towns and counties as the hotspot area. The right side flow map visualized the overall pattern of all employees in Suffolk. We can see that most employees were concentrated in the Boston area. On a larger scale, many activities occurred in Middlesex and Suffolk counties.</p>

		<p>How to perceive the number of 1 million people working in Suffolk? </p>
		<p>This physical installation consisted of six map layers. These layers were laser cut on clear acrylic panels. It framed the concept that the abstract data can become more connected to people’s perception of a place with a granular map scale. Because it has more spatial references relating to people's daily living and working environment.</p>

         <p>Drag to see the flow of all Boston Employees from home to workplace distribution. The front view shows the overall Massachusetts map where all Suffolk employees lived. Following the red thread through each layer, you can see Boston employees' workplace distributed in different neighborhoods and geo block-groups. The rear view shows the path of the individual flow: the most concentrated work block-group is in Downtown and where those people lived in Boston.</p>

		<h3>The Map Layers</h3>
		<p>This physical visualization draws the mobility pattern of all Boston employees. These granular map layers reveal the phenomena behind the number that connect with people's perception of Boston in reality, not just as an aggregated value. Boston has the most concentration of employees in Suffolk County. The densest of all working area in Boston is Downtown. Within Downtown the busiest hotspot are the large corporate offices and high building there.</p>
		<p><b>As the Origin:</b> 1,050,246 employees living in Massachusetts</p>
		<p><b>As Destinations:</b> Where they worked in Suffolk</p>

	<h2>A Web Application</h2>	
	</div>
	<div class="flow-half">
	<p>This interactive web application discusses visualization approaches for the origin to destination flow. It can visualize the pattern of all Boston Employee's work and home distribution. This tool will be applied to a practical use, to study the Boston commuters' mobility by the MBTA researchers.</p>
    <p>The choropleth map describes the workplace distribution in Boston at the geo block-group level while the color saturation changes indexes the volume of flow. It avoids visual cluster on the map by not using arc flow or dots to represents the value.</p>

    <div class="flow-half">
    <p>When the user clicks the button "Where People Live" in the right-side search panel, the interface will update to the tree node diagram. It draws the pattern of homeplace distribution at each geographic level, from state, to county, to towns, and finally geo block-group. Also, each tree node can expand and correspond to its geographic location in the map window, when the user mouse clicks on it.</p>
    <p>This tree node diagram has a similar function to the Sankey diagram. It shows the intermediate steps and evolution changes among different stages. And it allows visual comparison of the flow value at different geographic levels simultaneously.</p>
