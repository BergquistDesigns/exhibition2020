		<p>The Origin-Destination(O-D) pattern is a fundamental concept in transportation. It summarizes people and vehicle movements across geographical regions. Visualizing Boston employees’ home and work distribution is one way to understand Boston commuters’ mobility pattern and predict the commuters' needs for transit service planning.</p>
		<p>However, concerning the visual clarity for representing multi-dimensional data in a single plot, visualizing Origin-Destination (O-D) flow is always a challenge. This project discussed design approaches for it, and suggested how an abstract data value could become more connected with people’s perception of a place in reality.</p>

		<h2>The Mobility Pattern of Boston Employees</h2>
	</div>

	<div class="flow-half">
		<p>Boston is the capital city of Massachusetts and the region's central hub, located in Suffolk County. The right-side flow map describes the overall mobility pattern of all employees in Suffolk. It shows the highest concentration of employment were Boston and the nearby towns, as the hotspot area in Massachusetts.</p>
		<p>This visualization only can show the overall pattern and give a sense of the total volume of flows. But it has so many visual clusters of flows, lost is the individual trip view and the passthrough of the flow. One solution is that with a more granular mapping, it represents the flow variation in different, multi-dimensional geographic levels and more spatial references to reality.</p>

		<h2>A Physical Map Visualization</h2>

	<div class="flow-half">
		<p><b>How to map 1 million flows from work to home in Suffolk?</b></p>
		<p>This physical visualization maps the mobility pattern of all Boston employees, working and home distribution in different layers. It discusses a visualization approach for the Origin to Destination data – mapping with a 3D tree-node diagram, which has a similar function to the Sankey Arcs diagram. The line connects the origin and destinations, also the flow evolution changes across different geographic regions.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="flow-half">
	<p>It intends to frame the concept that mapping with more granularities, the multi-dimensional flow could be revealed with more layers and patterns. Also, the more granular geographic features can connect to people's perception of place in reality, to understand the abstract data.</p>

	<div class="flow-half">
	 <p>The front view shows the overall map where all Suffolk employees lived in Massachusetts' county. Following the red thread through each layer, you can see Boston employees' workplace distributed in different neighborhoods and geo block-groups. The rearview shows the path of an individual flow: the most concentrated work block-group is in Downtown and where those people lived in Boston.</p>

	<h2>The Map Layers</h2>
	</div>
	<div class="flow-half">
		<p>Seeing through these map layers, the flow patterns reveal the phenomena behind the number of 1 million workers. Boston has the most concentration of employees in Suffolk County. The densest of all working areas in Boston is Downtown. Within Downtown, the busiest hotspot is the large corporate offices and high building there.</p>
		<p>This physical visualization consists of six map layers. Layers were laser cut on clear acrylic panels. Then threaded the line and installed them at home during the COVID-19 period. However, it has a craft making process in this data visualization piece. It contains some aesthetics and human experiences on making and materials, also experiencing the data, which can’t be replaced by the digital version.</p>

		<p><b>As Destinations:</b> Where they worked in Suffolk</p>

	<h2>A Web Application</h2>

	<div class="flow-half">
	<p>Mapping with more granularity, and the 3D three-node diagram approaches will be implemented to an interactive web application, to visualize the flow pattern of all Boston Employee's work to home. Although, this web application discusses other visualization approaches for Origin-Destination (O-D) flow.</p>
    <p>The choropleth map describes the workplace distribution in Boston at the geo block-group level while the color saturation changes index the volume of flow. When the user clicks the button "Where People Live" in the right-side search panel, the interface will update to the tree node diagram.</p>

    <div class="flow-half">
    <p>It draws the pattern of homeplace distribution at each geographic level, from states to counties, to towns, and finally geo block-groups. Also, each tree-node can expand and correspond to its geographic location in the map window, when the user mouse clicks on it. </p>
    <p>The design for mapping this tree-node diagram to a web version will continue developing, and discussing other visualization approaches in the next step.</p>
