	<!--main description-->
	<p>The goal of this project is to translate the intricate movements in the Indian classical dance of Kathak into abstract and expressive visualizations using non-traditional methods of capturing movement. Indian classical dance performances have traditionally been used to communicate spiritual ideas, stories, and values dating as far back as 400BCE. These performances are a combination of facial expressions, intricate and well-structured movements, compelling narratives as well as accompanying musicals to form a unique experience for the audience. Kathak, originating from Northern India, is characterized by its rhythmic footwork in tandem with graceful upper body movements. </p>
	<p>It traditionally is a solo dance performance where the dancer wears bells around their ankles while they dance accompanied by traditional music. Even though the audiences in a live Kathak performance experience the composition, the complex physical movements of feet and arms are often intermingled and difficult to isolate. Dancers have thus relied on fragmented notational renderings as a means to preserve these subtle bodily movements. Nevertheless, Kathak dancers leave traces of their performances in the environment after they leave. Capturing these traces encourages dance enthusiasts and curious audiences to take a more intimate look at the complex movements in Indian classical dance performances, especially Kathak.</p>

	<p>My approach to this thesis is a visualization design exploration where I carry out multiple visualization experiments. This could be a valuable technique allowing information designers to not only challenge the existing knowledge of a phenomena (i.e. dance performance in this case) but also experience the phenomena by generating data in real time. I conducted these explorations using three inexpensive methods – tracing paint on paper, long exposure photography, and triaxial motion sensors to capture movement in Kathak dance.</p>
	<p>For the purpose of this thesis, I have used a sample choreography by Guru Pali Chandra called "Paran judi Aamad". The detailed bols and choreography for this composition can be found in her online Kathak curriculum at <a href="https://www.learnkathakonline.com/learnkathakonline.com">Learn Kathak
			Online</a> </p>

	<h2>01 Paint and movement</h2>
</div>
<div class="flow-half">
	<p>In order to capture the movement of the feet across the 2D plane of the floor, I used paint on paper to ink my feet and capture them on a white canvas placed on the floor. This allowed me to break down the choreography into the eight sections and preserve the complex movements. The end result was a series of eight visualizations that gave more insights into the patterns of foot movement and use of the stage (i.e., the 2D space on the floor). </p>

	<h2>02 Light and movement</h2>
</div>
<div class="flow-half">
	<p>In this experiment, I used light painting and tracing to visualize movements in the same choreography. I used techniques in photography and videography to track dance movements emitting from light sources attached to the body. I wore different colored LED light sources on my wrists (green color for right wrist and yellow color for left wrist) and ankles (green color for right ankle and yellow color for left ankle). The dance movements were captured in a video recording studio at Northeastern University, Boston, MA. The recording room was first set up to block all the external light and then turned into a dark room.</p>
	<p>In addition to the movement, I also captured the sound of the choreography – the sound of the ghungroos, bols, and the sounds of the slapping of the foot. The sound was recorded in the audio recording room of Northeastern University. The setup for this included three microphones placed on the floor, with one in front and two on both sides of the body.</p>

	<h2>03 Data and movement</h2>
</div>
<div class="flow-half">
	<p>Wearable sensors like accelerometers can provide highly precise data at a high sampling rate. I use this data in my experiment to explore various possibilities of visualizing movement of the selected choreography. </p>
	<p> For this experiment, I used four actigraph accelerometers two on my wrists and two on my ankles. The accelerometers were charged and pre-calibrated at a sampling rate of 80/sec. These accelerometers use an atomic clock and record continuously based on when the timer is set to record. The data collected from the accelerometer contains the X, Y, Z position of the accelerometer along with the timestamp.</p>
