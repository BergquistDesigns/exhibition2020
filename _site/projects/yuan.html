	<h2 class="subtitle">Rhetoric in Information Design to Communicate on Social Problems</h2>
</div>
<div class="flow-half project-description">
	<p>Design has been used as a representational medium to address social problems due to its persuasive
		impact. Designers have directly influenced the actions of individuals and communities, changed
		attitudes and values, and shaped society in surprisingly fundamental ways (Buchanan 1985).
		Rhetorical techniques are employed in the design process to achieve persuasion. Graphic design,
		industrial design, interaction design, and environmental design all accomplish persuasion to some
		extent. Information design specifically, with its features of data-based facts and visual-oriented
		presentation, can also leverage its persuasive power to address social problems.</p>
	<p>The values that distinguish information design from other kinds of design are efficiency and effectiveness at accomplishing the communicative purpose<br>(Jacobson 2000, 16). Through a systematic
		arrangement, information design manages the complexity of information overload in our modern society.
		Meanwhile, it also reveals the information in a neutral and transparent manner that does not obscure
		audiences’ reading. Apart from providing the audience with an opportunity to be exposed to complex
		data and social facts, it also focuses on more comprehensive visual forms to represent the data.
		This increases the understanding of those participating in a specific conversation or discourse
		(Jacobson 2000, 4) to devise a better persuasive message-delivering process.</p>

		<h2>Conceptual Frameworks</h2>
	</div>
	<div class="flow-half">
		<P>This thesis emphasizes the cognitive changes that information design can bring to people about
			social problems through persuasion. It attempts to perform an analysis of information design
			centering on persuasion. First, it proposes a theoretical framework that first modeling the
			relationships among information artifacts, audiences, and designers from a communicative
			perspective; then articulating the persuasive stages of information design — informing,
			nudging, and reasoning.</P>
			<P>Additionally, this thesis addresses the rhetorical aspect of
				information design by discussing the relationship of design
				and rhetoric, exploring the concepts and practices from
				existing rhetorical studies, and presenting the rhetorical taxonomy
				for information design. This taxonomy includes the rhetorical motivators and tactics
				I conclude and suggest for this domain.</P>

		<h2>Practical Projects</h2>
	</div>
	<div class="flow-half">
		<P>Finally, to explore the practical use of rhetoric in information design applied to a social issue,
			I launch a case study by addressing the social topic of recycling contamination.  Through
			implementing two design experiments with different rhetorical motivators and tactics, this
			practical project aims to (1) engage people in the issue of recycling contamination and (2)
			persuade people to take the initiative to recycle correctly thus avoiding contamination and (3)
			test the effectiveness of the rhetorical tactics in terms of persuasion by collecting people’s
			response to the design pieces. I connect the theoretical and the practical part of my thesis and
			present both in this exhibition. </P>

		<h3>ANATOMY OF RECYCLING BIN </h3>
	</div>
	<div class="flow-half">
		<p>The insides of curbside recycling bins are often hidden from the public. People only hear about
			the feel-good aspects of recycling and zero waste, and rarely do they hear about the other side
			— the inefficiency of recycling. </p>
		<p>By making the casing of the bins transparent, this experiment uncovers the messy inside of recycling
			bins. On one hand, it reveals the current recycling contamination problem by displaying the ideal
			bin that people usually imagine and the actual bin we have at the curbside. On the other hand,
			through the comparison between different items and states in two control bins, this experiment
			physicalizes the information to build a conversation with the audience, evoking them to conduct a
			self-reflection on their own recycling behavior.</p>

		<h3>REVEALING RECYCLING CONTAMINATION</h3>

	<div class="flow-half">
		<p>This experiment aims to create an informative while edifying design artifact to expose people to the recycling contamination issue. By presenting all the information in a booklet, this project
		tries to build a storyline which explains the problem comprehensively and proceeds in an orderly way, so as to better lead the audience to the topic.</p>
		<p>The booklet combines infographics and text to build the story. Different rhetoric motivators and	tactics are used in the storyline and graphics to articulate the contamination problem from different perspectives.After I finish designing the booklet, I will conduct a survey and have several interviews to test the effectiveness and persuasiveness of the tactics I used in this booklet. The booklet was planned to be distributed to the students at Northeastern University in a physical exhibition. Due to COVID-19, however, the test session will be moved online and launched in summer.</p>
