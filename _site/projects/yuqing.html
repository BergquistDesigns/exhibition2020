	<p><b>How have family compositions been changed over time?</b><br>
	<b>How different could a family be from others’ in many ways?</b><br>
	Census data could be a resource not just used by statisticians, demographers but also by designers whose work enables public access to the unexpected or unaware aspects to help the public understand themselves.</p>
	<p>This project looks at a few variations of census data like race, age, gender, etc for people living in Boston since 1860. The data visualizations below show different types of families in Boston. By bringing the visual representations about family, it reveals how people connect and also indicates less common family types that many people may be not aware of before.</p>

		<h3>Design</h3>
		<p>The visualization intends to classify individuals within households based on the census question about the individual's relationship to the householder. Over the years, most households are considered as one-family households. For those multi-family households, the census data also has indicator to identify individuals living as a family within a household.</p>

		<p>This project explores different visual languages to represent individuals and internal relationships within the family. Through abstract visual representations, contextualizing data brings these representations back to the actual families.</p>

		<p> The idea of presenting visualizations within photo frames not only reminisces audiences' personal experiences universally but also makes them feel the intimacy about family imaginations. Family portrait exhibition provides a place for people to take comfort in the fact that their family is not alone. </p>

	<div class="flow-half">
	<p>The partner category has been changed considerably in meaning in census over the years. Since 1990, the ACS (American Community Survey) offers 'Unmarried partner' as a subcategory which intends to distinguish those with a "close personal relationship" with the householder.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="flow-half">
	<p>According to the Census Bureau's policy, the "spouse" and the householder must be opposite genders. Before 1990, the 'partner/friend/roommate' is a relatively vague category, which refers to non-relatives who live in the household.</p>
