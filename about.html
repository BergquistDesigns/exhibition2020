		<p>We are the MFA class of 2020, nine graduate students studying Information and Experience Design at Northeastern University’s College of Arts, Media + Design. We began our last semester together planning an exhibition to showcase our final thesis projects, but finished the semester individually, scattered across the country due to the COVID–19 pandemic. </p>
		<p>Our show was titled, “UNFOLDING”. Our topics and approaches varied greatly, but each of our MFA thesis projects reflect the work of a student who picked a problem and used design to thoughtfully explore its complexities. We unfolded issues to reveal ideas that had previously been unclear. </p>
		<p>In March 2020, the pandemic forced Northeastern (and universities around the world) to transfer all programs online. Suddenly, a physical MFA exhibition was out of the question. And somehow, the theme of UNFOLDING seemed more appropriate than ever for our work.  </p>
		<p>The word UNFOLDING does not only imply revealing and understanding something that was hidden. UNFOLDING reminds us that we are in a state where many things are still hidden and unknown. The early days of the COVID-19 pandemic have been characterized by minute-to-minute updates. Decisions become paralyzing. Planning is ongoing, exhausting, and ever-changing. As designers, we have trained ourselves to embrace uncertainty. Yet the pandemic is pitting us against enormous uncertainty at a structural level. How do you plan for the future when you have no idea what that future looks like? </p>
		<p>This website showcases our thesis work, but it is also a space to share artifacts from the exhibition that never happened. We coordinated this online exhibit from home offices and bedrooms, designing with children running around and fighting noise levels with roommates on conference calls. Our situation is imperfect, but we are committed to sharing our work.  </p>

			<i>We are grateful for our experience at Northeastern.</i><br>
			<i>We mourn the connections and experiences that were cut short.</i><br>
			<i>We persist in the present.</i><br>
			<i>We hope for better things to unfold.</i><br>
