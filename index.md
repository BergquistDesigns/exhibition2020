# Unfolding—an action in progress  

*"Think of design as an unfolding process—a highly iterative combination of varied activities and outputs”* 

— Wayne C. Chung

Design is also the tool to reveal the thoughts of the designer behind the scenes. It is a channel for designers to transmit their voice and attitude. 

“Unfolding” is an intent to transmit and share our voice, on how we framed our design work by focusing on unfolding different problems that motivated us, and to think systemically on diverse action pathways. We wanted to share our work showcasing the unfolding of our design process and challenges we had to face throughout. Particularly in today's context, unfolding also represents a way to adapt and to be flexible to situations that unfold beyond our control. We, as designers, have learned that adapting to new scenarios and changing courses of action are not only fundamental to provide a good design approach, but necessary when considering design from a systematic perspective able to positively affect change.  This online exhibition is a testimony of that.
